- **HTML**: The HTML file contains the structure for the user interface, including a form to add entries, a section to display the financial summary, and a canvas to render the spending chart.
- **CSS**: The CSS file styles the elements of the page, providing a clean and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: The JavaScript handles the logic for:
  - Adding transactions to the list.
  - Updating the summary (income, expenses, and balance).
  - Storing transactions in the browser's local storage.
